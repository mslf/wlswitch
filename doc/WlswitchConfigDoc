'wlswitch' config is consists of pairs like this:
<left operand> = <right operand>

All spaces and tabilations will be removed (before left operand)
and will be replaced by single space symbol in next part of string.

You can quote right operand like this:
<left operand> = "<right operand>"
Usually it needs for path with spaces.

List of 'wlswitch' left operands for configurating it's behavior:
path = "some path with '/' symbol at the end"
	-- set the wallpapers directory path
	-- (images from this folder using by 'wlswitch')
switcher = "some switcher program"
	-- set the program which can set the wallpaper image from command line
	-- switcher calling looks like this:
	<$switcher $argumentString $imageFromPath>
argument = "some argument"
	-- add the 'some argument' to switcher program
	-- argumets will placed before path to image string
format = "some format name"
    -- add the 'some format name' to array of image formatsfor opening by  'wlswitch'
usingSubDirs = "yes" || "true" || "1"
    -- allow 'wlswitch' using subdirs for images scanning
delay = "some value"
	-- set the delay after wallpaper switching in seconds
shellProgram = "some shell program name"
	-- set the shell program used to run update script after wallpaper switching
	-- shell program calling looks like this:
	<$shellProgram $updateScript>
updateBeforeScript = "path to script"
	-- this script will runs before wallpaper markers calculating by shell program
updateAfterScript = "path to script"
	-- this script will runs after wallpaper markers calculatingg by shell program
dependConfig = "path to some depend config file"
	-- all next marker configs using for that depend config before next 'dependConfig' line is founded.
	-- see the DependConfigDoc for more information about modifying configs.
'marker name' = 'some reserved marker name'
	-- match the marker name (which can found in depend config) with reserver marker name, calculating by 'wlswitch'

List of reserved marker names:
avg
	-- mean color of all wallpaper image
smart
	-- if 'avg' > 'avgInvert' then will be 'avgInvert', else 'avg'
center
    -- mean color of wallpaper image's center
leftSide
    -- mean color of wallpaper image's left side
rightSide
    -- mean color of wallpaper image's right side
upSide
    -- mean color of wallpaper image's up side
downSide
    -- mean color of wallpaper image's down side
And theirs combinations with "DD", "D", "L", "LL", "InvertDD", "InvertD", "Invert", "InvertL", "InvertLL" strings.
DD
	-- DarkDark version of reserved marker
D
	-- Dark version of reserved marker
L
	-- Light version of reserved marker
LL
	-- LightLight version of reserved marker
Invert
	-- Inverted version of reserved marker
InvertDD
	-- Inverted version of DarkDark reserved marker
InvertD
	-- Inverted version of Dark reserved marker
InvertL
	-- Inverted version of Light reserved marker
InvertLL
	-- Inverted version of LightLight reserved marker
